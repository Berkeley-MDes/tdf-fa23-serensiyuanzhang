# Report 2-week of 09/6/2023(week2)
### :star: summary: ###
This week I reviewed **grasshopper and computational design** on Thursday class.

After analysing the product I designed last week, I think it maybe a little boring for the product form, so this week I plan to reshape the model using rhino and grasshopper plugin Ameba/Millipede, which can do some **structure topology optimization**.

To design a phonestand holder, it is important that its stressed structure needs to be stable as well as the form needs to be attravtive. So I want to concern both structure and form while design the cellphone stander with the computational method-- structure topology optimization.

I used to do some structure topology optimization to design streamlined buildingï¼š

# Speculations #

I believe that design cellphone stand with concerning about both function and form is important in industrial design and the design process I explored represents the computational design methodology could help us improve our design. Next week I plan to try some 3D printing, I really hope I can make the prototype out and explore the influence of material to design.

# Reflection #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of wood with laser cutting. Check out all my progress photos.

This week, I also reviewed the usage of grasshopper, and helped my classmates understand the operating logic of the battery pack and adjust the battery.

# Speculations #

I think the industrial design world is rapidly being changed by artificial intelligence, and next I plan to try to use artificial intelligence tools to generate 3D products.
