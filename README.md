# Report 10-week of 11/2/2023
This week I tried to **build my own knownledge set and link it to my agents"mini seren"**, during this experience, I have meet some problems and I finally solved it which msde me feel powerful.
In the end, I achieved the goal I initially set out to accomplish. I built an agent that possesses knowledge of my TDF project, and it can provide answers to the interlocutor's questions in a more academic manner.

<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/a5f1a964b27e8d98c2e90e3f59a41dc73980c3c1/week9_10/7.jpg">

# Process #
In the process of building the knowledge set, I initially uploaded the complete project report. However, due to platform settings, my weekly reports were categorized by page numbers, which resulted in the construction of my knowledge set. As a result, my agent did not understand my corpus, leading to absurd and garbled responses during my conversations with it.
However, through my classification and organization of the knowledge base, after two attempts, I was able to resolve this issue.

# Reflection #
Through this assignment, my understanding of agent-related knowledge has increased, and I have also learned more about the fundamental concepts of large models. However, regarding the ZeroWidth platform, I still believe that it could be designed to be more user-friendly from various aspects, including interface design.

# Speculations #
By integrating with large models, the potential of agents seems almost limitless. As mentioned in the paper 'Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,' through the design of agents, we can even create a digital twin system that exists outside of human society. This makes me very excited!

# Report 9-week of 10/26/2023
This week I tried to **build my minime and design three experiments**to test the different parameters in ZeroWidth, during this experience, I have gained a deeper understanding of concepts related to tokens and prompt engineering in large models.

<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/13159e48bfe35db6bbba82a33bcbd1fba6470301/week9_10/4.jpg">

# Process #
In the first experiment, I tried different prompts and observed the conversation results of the agent. I also experimented with various temperatures to understand how different prompts and parameters affect the outcomes.

<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/357dca6937e4f2dce02712c7add52dc52707c7a0/week9_10/1.jpg">


In the second experiment, I experimented with different roles and, through testing the responses, observed the differences between the 'instruction' and 'user' roles as parameters. By changing the role, it's possible to alter the speaking habits and language style of the agent.

<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/13159e48bfe35db6bbba82a33bcbd1fba6470301/week9_10/6.jpg">


In the third experiment, I experimented with different temperatures, and I found that the higher the value, the better the generated results.

<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/13159e48bfe35db6bbba82a33bcbd1fba6470301/week9_10/8.jpg">



# Reflection #
Through the three experiments this week, I have deepened my understanding of concepts related to large models and gained a better understanding of the significance of prompts in large models. Prompt engineering holds great potential, and as designers, we should learn how to better utilize them. With advancements in tools, we can empower our designs.

# Speculations #
I'm very excited about this platform. I believe it represents a practical innovation in the application of natural language large models, and I'm looking forward to seeing it being used in our everyday lives as soon as possible.

# Report 8-week of 10/19/2023

This week four members of our team have begun the final integration. We are transmitting signals from Photon to the Unity platform and have combined software and hardware to build our own demo. In addition to this, we have created a 3D prototype for our design and brought it to life through laser cutting.

<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/13159e48bfe35db6bbba82a33bcbd1fba6470301/week9_10/4.jpg">

# Process #

In this project, I made multiple attempts with Photon. Starting from the initial stage where I could only connect a small light bulb, I eventually progressed to the point where I could connect a light sensor and a humidity sensor, enabling data communication between the two boards. This process was quite lengthy and included numerous failed attempts. However, fortunately, I was able to achieve the end goal.Not only that, but we also attempted to integrate Photon with Unity, transmitting signals into Unity to achieve an augmented reality effect.

# Report 5-week of 09/28/2023

This week I tried to **photon2**to build a digital ecosystem.In this project, I choose Level 03-Axolotl. I choose this level because I have never met the hardware design before 
and in this project I tried my best to use photon and particle platform to create a project. It is a challenge for me.


<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/13159e48bfe35db6bbba82a33bcbd1fba6470301/week9_10/4.jpg">

# Reflection #
After a week's brainstorm, here is a description of our project:
Welcome to the Build Your Garden project, set in a world where climate change is reshaping the environment we once knew. 
Understanding human impact on our ecosystem is essential and urgent. We introduce a digital ecosystem designed to preserve plant collections and construct virtual gardens. Beyond providing an entertainment and meditative space, it also serves as an instructional tool. It documents how plants are affected by environmental disasters as well as showcases how plants adapt to changing conditions, demonstrating remarkable resilience and reminding us of the very essence of life.
An essential interaction point within our digital ecosystem begins with this portable device. When encountering a plant, you can put the device near the plant and push its sensors into the ground. The incorporated sensors capture vital environmental data, such as sunlight and soil conditions. This data is then transmitted to and processed by a secondary board. In the prototype, we demonstrate the connection with the secondary Photon board connected to our Unity engine running on a laptop to highlight our imagined functionality. Ideally, this relay will be further integrated into a separate independent device, serving as another touchpoint. It will have an interactive visual interface that enables you to generate the exact plant you collect in a virtual garden and access its information.
Through direct interaction with plants in real life and then revisiting them on a portable device with web-based data, you can explore various plant species, document changes in their appearance, and track variations in their growth conditions across time and in different locations.
We aimed to address various challenges, including integrating environmental sensors, reading and transmitting sensor data between microcontrollers and web platforms, and developing a user-friendly visual interface that efficiently interprets the collected data to improve the overall user experience.
Starting with building the initial sensor-embedded board, we tested the sensor functions and developed code to read real-time data. At the same time, we were trying out ways to establish a connection between the Photon board and the Unity-powered interface. After several iterations, we were able to grow plants in Unity when interacting with the physical sensors!
For our project, we aim to enhance the capabilities of the first device by integrating a camera and additional environmental sensors. This will be accompanied by adopting an open-source plant classification algorithm. We also plan to incorporate multiple plant-specific touchpoints that allow users to monitor specific plants they favor and reflect plants' changes in virtual gardens. It would be meaningful if users could also visualize the condition of their garden's plants, whether they are flourishing or struggling, based on users' real-world location data. 
We want to explore how the concept and design of the digital ecosystem can be mapped onto and establish communication with our natural ecosystem. This question/speculation seeks to help us better understand the environment we inhabit.

# Report 4-week of 09/21/2023

This week I tried to complete the design of my phone stand and tried to enhance my Grasshopper program to adjust the form of my phone stand. During this week, I learned how to 3D print and bring my conceptual ideas into practical realization.
In the end, I adjusted my phone stand design based on the dimensions of my own phone and the angle and posture I use when viewing the phone screen. Additionally, by using Grasshopper plugins, I improved the aesthetics of my phone stand.

<img width="800" alt="Measure the length of the phone" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-serensiyuanzhang/blob/b87ad145a48dddd9b63bf71c7b80ab83d1423ba9/week1_5/9.jpg">

# Process #
This week I developed my own grasshopper file based on the scale of my own phone and my own need. And then I used grasshopper plug-in Lunchbox to develop my design. Finally, I tried my best to print it out.
The first step is to develop the grasshopper file from the class and I made a Mindmap in Figma. The following step is “construct plane----construct cube----construct sphere----boolean operation----brep----add phone object----final brep.”

I choose the challenge level as 02-Platypusz. I think what was difficult for me in this task was not how to learn grasshopper, because I already had relevant experience with it during my undergraduate studies. The hard part is how to use plug-ins to optimize my designs. And use it to meet my user needs. So I chose this level of challenge, which is in the middle, not that easy and not that difficult.

# Reflection #
 In this week, the challenge was how to 3D print the prototype of my design. At first, I tried the printer on the first floor, but unfortunately, the nozzle of this printer was broken, so that it could not print the material reasonably, which ultimately delayed the progress of my job. Cody provided me with some help, but the machine never worked very well.

 I thought I could no longer present it until I found some printers and untimaker on the second floor of Jacob, and completed its training, 
successfully adjusted the printer's machine temperature, and spent 7 hours setting up my mobile phone holder. The prototype was printed. That is awesome!

# Report 3-week of 09/14/2023

This week at first I plan to use the grasshopper plug-in to improve my design for cellphone holder. Ameba, amoeba, Chinese transliteration is amoeba, so it is also called amoeba. It is a single-celled protozoa, made up of just one cell, that can change its body shape as needed. Xie Yimin Technology, a Chinese team led by Academician Xie Yimin, developed the topology optimization design software Ameba based on the bidirectional progressive structural optimization method (BESO) proposed by him. Users can apply mechanical and other boundary conditions to the initial design area according to design needs, and optimize it through software calculations. When solving, the design area will evolve into various shapes like an amoeba, and finally obtain a form with reasonable force transmission and bionics.However, after several attempts, I found that although the optimized mobile phone holder met the mechanical requirements, it was not beautiful and did 
not meet my daily usage habits. So after two days of trying, I gave up on this plan.

From an aesthetic point of view, I tried another plug-in for grasshopper, LunchBox. LunchBox is a plug-in for Grasshopper for exploring mathematical shapes, paneling, structures, and workflow. I mainly used these five button, Diamond Panels, Triangle Panels B, Skewed Quads, 3D Supershape, Diamond Grid to build my cellphone holder.

# Reflection #
  This week's challenge for me was finding a plugin for Grasshopper that met my user needs. I wanted to start with form, but I didn’t want to give up on mechanical considerations. So I used ameba first, but I found it very difficult to find the balance between the two. Then I turned to lunchbox again. Focus more on morphological than mechanical considerations. This time I succeeded and it took me almost a week.

# Report 2-week of 09/7/2023

### :star: summary: ###
This week I reviewed **grasshopper and computational design** on Thursday class.

After analysing the product I designed last week, I think it maybe a little boring for the product form, so this week I plan to reshape the model using rhino and grasshopper plugin Ameba/Millipede, which can do some **structure topology optimization**.

To design a phonestand holder, it is important that its stressed structure needs to be stable as well as the form needs to be attravtive. So I want to concern both structure and form while design the cellphone stander with the computational method-- structure topology optimization.

I used to do some structure topology optimization to design streamlined building：

# Speculations #

I believe that design cellphone stand with concerning about both function and form is important in industrial design and the design process I explored represents the computational design methodology could help us improve our design. Next week I plan to try some 3D printing, I really hope I can make the prototype out and explore the influence of material to design.
