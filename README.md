# Report 10-week of 11/2/2023(week10)
This week I tried to **build my own knownledge set and link it to my agents"mini seren"**, during this experience, I have meet some problems and I finally solved it which msde me feel powerful.
In the end, I achieved the goal I initially set out to accomplish. I built an agent that possesses knowledge of my TDF project, and it can provide answers to the interlocutor's questions in a more academic manner.
# Process #
In the process of building the knowledge set, I initially uploaded the complete project report. However, due to platform settings, my weekly reports were categorized by page numbers, which resulted in the construction of my knowledge set. As a result, my agent did not understand my corpus, leading to absurd and garbled responses during my conversations with it.
However, through my classification and organization of the knowledge base, after two attempts, I was able to resolve this issue.
# Reflection #
Through this assignment, my understanding of agent-related knowledge has increased, and I have also learned more about the fundamental concepts of large models. However, regarding the ZeroWidth platform, I still believe that it could be designed to be more user-friendly from various aspects, including interface design.

# Speculations #
By integrating with large models, the potential of agents seems almost limitless. As mentioned in the paper 'Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,' through the design of agents, we can even create a digital twin system that exists outside of human society. This makes me very excited!

# Report 9-week of 10/26/2023(week9)
This week I tried to **build my minime and design three experiments**to test the different parameters in ZeroWidth, during this experience, I have gained a deeper understanding of concepts related to tokens and prompt engineering in large models.

# Process #
In the first experiment, I tried different prompts and observed the conversation results of the agent. I also experimented with various temperatures to understand how different prompts and parameters affect the outcomes.

In the second experiment, I experimented with different roles and, through testing the responses, observed the differences between the 'instruction' and 'user' roles as parameters. By changing the role, it's possible to alter the speaking habits and language style of the agent.

In the third experiment, I experimented with different temperatures, and I found that the higher the value, the better the generated results.

# Reflection #
Through the three experiments this week, I have deepened my understanding of concepts related to large models and gained a better understanding of the significance of prompts in large models. Prompt engineering holds great potential, and as designers, we should learn how to better utilize them. With advancements in tools, we can empower our designs.

# Speculations #
I'm very excited about this platform. I believe it represents a practical innovation in the application of natural language large models, and I'm looking forward to seeing it being used in our everyday lives as soon as possible.

### :star: summary: ###
This week I reviewed **grasshopper and computational design** on Thursday class.

After analysing the product I designed last week, I think it maybe a little boring for the product form, so this week I plan to reshape the model using rhino and grasshopper plugin Ameba/Millipede, which can do some **structure topology optimization**.

To design a phonestand holder, it is important that its stressed structure needs to be stable as well as the form needs to be attravtive. So I want to concern both structure and form while design the cellphone stander with the computational method-- structure topology optimization.

I used to do some structure topology optimization to design streamlined buildingï¼š

# Reflection #
+ analyse
+ design conception
+ computational design process

# Speculations #

I believe that design cellphone stand with concerning about both function and form is important in industrial design and the design process I explored represents the computational design methodology could help us improve our design. Next week I plan to try some 3D printing, I really hope I can make the prototype out and explore the influence of material to design.

# Speculations #

I think the industrial design world is rapidly being changed by artificial intelligence, and next I plan to try to use artificial intelligence tools to generate 3D products.
