# Report 10-week of 11/2/2023(week2)
This week I tried to **build my own knownledge set and link it to my agents"mini seren"**, during this experience, I have meet some problems and I finally solved it which msde me feel powerful.
In the end, I achieved the goal I initially set out to accomplish. I built an agent that possesses knowledge of my TDF project, and it can provide answers to the interlocutor's questions in a more academic manner.
# Process #
In the process of building the knowledge set, I initially uploaded the complete project report. However, due to platform settings, my weekly reports were categorized by page numbers, which resulted in the construction of my knowledge set. As a result, my agent did not understand my corpus, leading to absurd and garbled responses during my conversations with it.
However, through my classification and organization of the knowledge base, after two attempts, I was able to resolve this issue.
# Reflection #
Through this assignment, my understanding of agent-related knowledge has increased, and I have also learned more about the fundamental concepts of large models. However, regarding the ZeroWidth platform, I still believe that it could be designed to be more user-friendly from various aspects, including interface design.

### :star: summary: ###
This week I reviewed **grasshopper and computational design** on Thursday class.

After analysing the product I designed last week, I think it maybe a little boring for the product form, so this week I plan to reshape the model using rhino and grasshopper plugin Ameba/Millipede, which can do some **structure topology optimization**.

To design a phonestand holder, it is important that its stressed structure needs to be stable as well as the form needs to be attravtive. So I want to concern both structure and form while design the cellphone stander with the computational method-- structure topology optimization.

I used to do some structure topology optimization to design streamlined buildingï¼š

# Reflection #
+ analyse
+ design conception
+ computational design process

# Speculations #

I believe that design cellphone stand with concerning about both function and form is important in industrial design and the design process I explored represents the computational design methodology could help us improve our design. Next week I plan to try some 3D printing, I really hope I can make the prototype out and explore the influence of material to design.

This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of wood with laser cutting. Check out all my progress photos.

This week, I also reviewed the usage of grasshopper, and helped my classmates understand the operating logic of the battery pack and adjust the battery.

# Speculations #

I think the industrial design world is rapidly being changed by artificial intelligence, and next I plan to try to use artificial intelligence tools to generate 3D products.
